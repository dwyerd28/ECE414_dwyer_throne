Project Overview:
This project implements a 2D drawing robot capable of reproducing predefined
coordinate paths onto paper using pen. The system is controlled by the Raspberry 
Pi Pico and uses a CoreXY configuration driven by two stepper motors and a servo
motor. Drawing is executed throuhg a FSM that manages of initialization, motion,
pen controls and completion.

Hardware materials:
Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040)
Two NEMA 17 stepper motors
Two DRV8825 stepper motor drivers
SG90 servo motor (pen up/down)
GT2 timing belts and pulleys (CoreXY configuration)
LCD display (non-touch mode)
External motor power supply
Mechanical drawing frame

Project structure:
main.c:
Implements the finite state machine (FSM) that controls overall system behavior.
motor.c / motor.h:
Handles CoreXY motion control, step pulse generation, and direction logic for the stepper motors.
coordsetup.c / coordsetup.h:
Defines the drawing path as a list of X/Y coordinate points and pen states.
limits.c / limits.h:
Enforces software-defined motion limits to prevent movement outside the drawing area.
servo.c / servo.h:
Controls pen up/down motion using PWM.
LCD-related files:
Provide display functionality for drawing progress and system status.

How to run project:
1) Connect all hardware components to pins definitions in source code.
2) Open the project using Raspberry Pi Pico SDK
3) Build and flash  the firmware to pico
4) power stepper motors using external power supply
5) place paper and pen in drawing area
6) Power on system
